## Getting Started

* Read the [README](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/blob/main/README.md) from the Kobweb repository to install the Kobweb binary.

* Run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:

```bash
$ cd site
$ kobweb run
```

* Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can use any editor you want for the project, but we recommend using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.
